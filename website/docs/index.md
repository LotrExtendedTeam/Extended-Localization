# Localization

This site provides a visual overview of the modâ€™s localization progress across all supported [Minecraft languages](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Language).
Localization is tracked separately for each localizable text/file type.

## Extended Localization

## Renewed Override Localizations

This section documents the ongoing localization of everything added by [*Renewed*](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-lord-of-the-rings-mod-renewed).

Many languages in Renewed have incomplete, incorrect, or entirely missing translations. This project aims to provide players with thorough high-quality, and accurate mod translations.

We actively support languages that were not originally translated in Renewed.
